Vitaly503 is given a checkered board with a side of 𝑛 and 𝑘 chips. He realized that all these 𝑘 chips need to be placed
on the cells of the board (no more than one chip can be placed on a single cell).

Let's denote the cell in the 𝑖-th row and 𝑗-th column as (𝑖,𝑗). A diagonal is the set of cells for which the value 𝑖+𝑗 is
the same. For example, cells (3,1), (2,2), and (1,3) lie on the same diagonal, but (1,2) and (2,3) do not. A diagonal is
called occupied if it contains at least one chip.

Determine what is the minimum possible number of occupied diagonals among all placements of 𝑘 chips.

Input
Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a single integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤500) — the number of
sets of input data. Then follow the descriptions of the sets of input data.

The only line of each set of input data contains two integers 𝑛, 𝑘 (1≤𝑛≤100,0≤𝑘≤𝑛2) — the side of the checkered board
and the number of available chips, respectively.

Output
For each set of input data, output a single integer — the minimum number of occupied diagonals with at least one chip
that he can get after placing all 𝑘 chips.
